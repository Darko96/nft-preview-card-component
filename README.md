## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

This is second project in my life so I learned a lot of things but the most important one is I think that,
I learned how to use media queries and how to use my project on phones.

### Continued development

I'll definitely focus more on media queries because I need a lot of practice if I want to master it.
